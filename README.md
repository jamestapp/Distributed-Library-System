# Distributed-Library-System

This project contains the code for a distributed library system, checking in and out books, and maintaining several potential day to day activities a librarian may undertake.

This was produced as part of my masters degree in Computing at Cardiff University. The code used to call and test was not made available to me, however the project scored 100/100. 

Technologies used are Python including the Pyro library, and distributed systems implementation.
